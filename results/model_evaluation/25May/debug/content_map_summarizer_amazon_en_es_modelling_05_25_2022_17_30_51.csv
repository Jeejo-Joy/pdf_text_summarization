Sustainability accounting reflects the governance andmanagement of a company’s environmental and social impacts arising from production of goods and services, as well asits governance and management of the environmental and social capitals necessary to create long-term value. The SASBStandards also refer to sustainability as “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance), though traditional corporategovernance issues such as board composition are not included within the scope of the SASB Standards.SASB Standards are designed to identify a minimum set of sustainability issues most likely to impact the operatingperformance or financial condition of the typical company in an industry, regardless of location. SASB Standards aredesigned to enable communications on corporate performance on industry-level sustainability issues in a cost-effectiveand decision-useful manner using existing disclosure and reporting mechanisms.Businesses can use the SASB Standards to better identify, manage, and communicate to investors sustainabilityinformation that is financially material. Use of the Standards can benefit businesses by improving transparency, riskmanagement, and performance. SASB Standards can help investors by encouraging reporting that is comparable,consistent, and financially material, thereby enabling investors to make better investment and voting decisions."
Overview of SASB Standards,4,2.0,0,,Introduction,"The SASB Standards board has developed a set of 77 industry-specific sustainability accounting standards (“SASBStandards” or “industry standards”), categorized pursuant to the SASB Sustainable Industry Classification System®(SICS®). Each SASB Standard describes the industry that is the subject of the Standard, including any assumptions aboutthe predominant business model and industry segments that are included. SASB Standards include:1. Disclosure topics – A minimum set of industry-specific disclosure topics reasonably likely to constitute materialinformation, and a brief description of how management or mismanagement of each topic may affect value creation.2. Accounting metrics – A set of quantitative and/or qualitative accounting metrics intended to measure performanceon each topic.3. Technical protocols – Each accounting metric is accompanied by a technical protocol that provides guidance ondefinitions, scope, implementation, compilation, and presentation, all of which are intended to constitute suitable criteriafor third-party assurance.4. Activity metrics – A set of metrics that quantify the scale of a company’s business and are intended for use inconjunction with accounting metrics to normalize data and facilitate comparison.SUSTAINABILITY ACCOUNTING STANDARD | METALS & MINING | 4Furthermore, the SASB Standards Application Guidance establishes guidance applicable to the use of all industrystandards and is considered part of the standards. Unless otherwise specified in the technical protocols contained in theindustry standards, the guidance in the SASB Standards Application Guidance applies to the definitions, scope,implementation, compilation, and presentation of the metrics in the industry standards.The SASB Conceptual Framework sets out the basic concepts, principles, definitions, and objectives that guide theStandards Board in its approach to setting standards for sustainability accounting. The SASB Rules of Procedure is focusedon the governance processes and practices for standards setting."
Use of the Standards,5,2.0,0,,Introduction,"SASB Standards are intended for use in communications to investors regarding sustainability issues that are likely toimpact corporate ability to create value over the long term. Use of SASB Standards is voluntary. A company determineswhich Standard(s) is relevant to the company, which disclosure topics are financially material to its business, and whichassociated metrics to report, taking relevant legal requirements into account1. In general, a company would use the SASBStandard specific to its primary industry as identified in SICS® . However, companies with substantial business in multipleSICS® industries can consider reporting on these additional SASB Standards.It is up to a company to determine the means by which it reports SASB information to investors. One benefit of usingSASB Standards may be achieving regulatory compliance in some markets. Other investor communications using SASBinformation could be sustainability reports, integrated reports, websites, or annual reports to shareholders. There is noguarantee that SASB Standards address all financially material sustainability risks or opportunities unique to a company’sbusiness model."

Greenhouse Gas Emissions,9,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryMining operations are energy-intensive and generate significant direct greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, including carbondioxide from fuel use during mining, ore processing, and smelting activities. The extent and type of GHG emissions canvary depending on the metal mined and processed. Regulatory efforts to reduce GHG emissions in response to the risksposed by climate change may result in additional regulatory compliance costs and risks for metals and mining companiesdue to climate change mitigation policies. Operational efficiencies can be achieved through the cost-effective reduction ofGHG emissions. Such efficiencies can mitigate the potential financial impact of increased fuel costs from regulations thatseek to limit—or put a price on—GHG emissions.Accounting MetricsEM-MM-110a.1.

Energy Management,15,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryMining and metals production is often energy-intensive, with a significant proportion of energy consumption in theindustry accounted for by purchased electricity. While fuel combustion on-site contributes to the industry’s direct (Scope1) GHG emissions, electricity purchases from the grid can result in indirect, Scope 2 emissions. The energy intensity ofoperations may increase with decreasing grades of deposits and increasing depth and scale of mining operations. Thechoice between on-site versus grid-sourced electricity, and use of alternative energy, can play an important role ininfluencing both the costs and reliability of energy supply. Affordable and easily accessible energy is an importantcompetitive factor in a commodity market driven by global competition, and purchased fuels and electricity can accountfor a significant proportion of total production costs. The way in which a company manages its overall energy efficiencyand intensity, its reliance on different types of energy, and its ability to access alternative sources of energy, can thereforebe a material factor.Accounting MetricsEM-MM-130a.1.

Biodiversity Impacts,24,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryThe development, operation, closure, and remediation of mines can have a range of impacts on biodiversity, such asalterations of landscape, vegetation removal, and impacts to wildlife habitats. Acid rock drainage is a particularlysignificant risk: it is highly acidic water, rich in heavy metals, formed when surface and shallow subsurface water comeinto contact with mining overburden. Acid rock drainage can have harmful effects on humans, animals, and plants.Biodiversity impacts of mining operations can affect the valuation of reserves and create operational risks. Theenvironmental characteristics of the land where reserves are located could increase extraction costs due to increasinginterest in the protection of ecosystems. Companies could also face regulatory or reputational barriers to accessingreserves in ecologically sensitive areas. This may include new protection status afforded to areas where reserves arelocated. Metals and mining companies face regulatory risks related to reclamation after a mine is decommissioned, perapplicable regulatory requirements to restore mined property according to a prior, approved reclamation plan. Materialcosts may arise from removing or covering refuse piles, meeting water treatment obligations, and dismantlinginfrastructure at the end of life. Furthermore, ongoing mining operations are subject to laws protecting endangeredspecies. Companies that have an effective environmental management plan for different stages of the project lifecyclemay minimize their compliance costs and legal liabilities, face less resistance in developing new mines, and avoiddifficulties in obtaining permits, accessing reserves, and facing delays in project completion.Accounting MetricsEM-MM-160a.1.

"Security, Human Rights & Rights of Indigenous Peoples",29,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryMetals and mining companies face additional community-related risks when operating in conflict zones and in areas withweak or absent governance institutions, rule of law, and legislation to protect human rights. They also face risks whenoperating in areas with vulnerable communities, such as indigenous peoples. Companies using private or governmentsecurity forces to protect their workers and assets may knowingly, or unknowingly, contribute to human rights violations,including use of excessive force. Indigenous people are often the most vulnerable sections of the population, with limitedcapacity to defend their unique rights and interests. Companies perceived as contributing to human rights violations orfailing to account for indigenous peoples’ rights may be affected due to protests, riots, or suspension of permits. Theycould face substantial costs related to compensation or settlement payments, and write-downs in the value of theirreserves in such areas. In the absence of country laws to address such cases, several international instruments haveemerged to provide guidelines for companies. These instruments include obtaining the free, prior, and informed consentof indigenous peoples for decisions affecting them. With greater awareness, several countries are also beginning toimplement specific laws protecting indigenous peoples’ rights, creating increasing regulatory risk for companies.Accounting MetricsEM-MM-210a.1.

Community Relations,34,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryMining facilities are frequently active over long periods of time, and companies may be involved in multiple projects in aregion that can have a wide range of community impacts. Community rights and interests may be affected throughenvironmental and social impacts of mining operations, such as competition for access to local energy or water resources,air and water emissions, and waste from operations. Mining companies rely upon support from local communities to beable to obtain permits and leases as well as to conduct their activities without disruptions. Companies may experienceadverse financial impacts if the community interferes, or lobbies its government to interfere, with the rights of a miningcompany in relation to their ability to access, develop, and produce reserves. In addition to community concerns aboutdirect impacts of projects, the presence of mining activities may give rise to associated socio-economic concerns, such aseducation, health, livelihoods, and food security for the community. Metals and mining companies that are perceived asengaging in rent-seeking and exploiting a country or community’s resources without providing any socio-economicbenefits in return may be exposed to the risk of actions, motivated by resource nationalism, and by host governments andcommunities. These could include imposition of ad hoc taxes and export restrictions. Companies in the extractivesindustries can adopt various community engagement strategies in their global operations to manage risks andopportunities associated with community rights and interests. Strategies are often underpinned by the integration ofcommunity engagement into phases of the project cycle.

Labor Relations,38,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryMetals and mining companies face inherent tension between the need to lower the cost of labor to remain pricecompetitive, and to manage human resources to ensure long-term performance. Working conditions related to metal andmining operations are usually physically demanding and hazardous. Labor unions play a key role in representing workers’interests and managing collective bargaining for better wages and working conditions. At the same time, metals andmining companies often operate in areas where worker rights are not adequately protected. The nuances of bothdomestic and international worker concerns make management of labor relations critical for metals and miningcompanies. Conflict with workers can result in labor strikes and other disruptions that can delay or stop production. Workstoppages frequently result in significant lost revenue and reputational damage. Continued labor stresses can impact thelong-term profitability of the business. At the same time, positive outcomes of effective labor engagement can includeenhanced work practices, labor utilization, as well as the reduction in safety incidents, accidents, or fatalities.Accounting MetricsEM-MM-310a.1.

Tailings Storage Facilities Management,44,2.0,0,,Sustainability Disclosure Topics & Accounting Metrics,"Topic SummaryThe Metals & Mining industry faces significant operational hazards, particularly those associated with the structuralintegrity of tailings storage facilities (TSFs). A catastrophic failure of such facilities (e.g., a dam failure) can releasesignificant volumes of waste streams and materials that are potentially harmful to the environment, leading to high-consequence impacts on ecosystems, human livelihood, local economies, and communities. Such catastrophic incidentsmay result in significant financial losses for companies and erode their social license to operate. Robust processes andapproaches to TSF design, management, operation, and closure, as well as appropriate management of associated risks,can help prevent such incidents from occurring. Companies that adopt robust practices to maintain the integrity andsafety of TSFs may do so through assigning accountability for tailings management at the highest levels of the company,conducting frequent internal and external independent technical reviews of TSFs, and ensuring that mitigation measuresare implemented in a timely manner in case of a safety concern. Additionally, a strong safety culture and well-establishedemergency preparedness and response plans can mitigate the impacts and financial implications of such events shouldthey occur. Company obligations related to long-term remediation and compensation for damages may result inadditional financial impacts in case of a failure.
