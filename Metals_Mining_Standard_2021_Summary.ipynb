The SASBStandards also refer to sustainability as “ESG” (environmental, social, and governance), though traditional corporategovernance issues such as board composition are not included within the scope of the SASB Standards.SASB Standards are designed to identify a minimum set of sustainability issues most likely to impact the operatingperformance or financial condition of the typical company in an industry, regardless of location. SASB Standards aredesigned to enable communications on corporate performance on industry-level sustainability issues in a cost-effectiveand decision-useful manner using existing disclosure and reporting mechanisms.Businesses can use the SASB Standards to better identify, manage, and communicate to investors sustainabilityinformation that is financially material. Use of the Standards can benefit businesses by improving transparency, riskmanagement, and performance.
